            “The frequently cited metaphor of the history of life on Earth, in which human civilization occupies only the final ‘second’ of the ‘day’ during which life has so far existed, is misleading. In reality, a substantial proportion of all evolution on our planet to date has occurred in human brains. And it has barely begun. The whole of biological evolution was but a preface to the main story of evolution, the evolution of memes.” - David Deutsch, The Beginning of Infinity

        <b>Our Mantra</b>
        <p>
            Every technological revolution is an artistic revolution.<br><br>
            The printing press broke the church’s grip on storytelling. The camera freed painters from realism. The blockchain untethers the artist from the institution.<br><br>
            This is not a break with history. This is history. The Renaissance masters were technologists, experimenting with the latest tools of their age. The Bauhaus visionaries were systems designers. Today’s digital artists evolve in the same lineage.<br><br>
            The medium changes. The impulse does not.<br><br>
            The constraints of the old world – gatekeepers, scarcity, control – are dissolving. In their place: autonomy, abundance, and an infinite game of artistic possibility.<br><br>
            The future artist is not alone. The future artist is a network. A coder. A creator wielding machine intelligence as a brush.<br><br>
            We believe the tools of the next artistic revolution are already here. The artists who embrace them will shape the culture of the future.<br><br>
            We recognize that technology does not replace art; it expands its boundaries. It gives artists new languages, new dimensions, and new ways to reach the human soul.<br><br>
            We reject the nostalgia that mourns the past while ignoring the unprecedented access, tools, and platforms that empower artists today.<br><br>
            We celebrate the internet, which has made it possible for a creator in one corner of the world to share their vision with millions instantly. Cryptographic provenance enables artists to maintain control and ownership over their work in ways never before possible.<br><br>
            We hold art to be the highest form of human expression—the bridge between imagination and reality, past and future. It is the raw material of culture, the memory of civilization, the aesthetic force of progress.<br><br>
            We submit that technology and art are not opposites; they are symbiotic forces, each driving the other forward in an endless loop of creation and reinvention. Generative art, AI-assisted creativity, and decentralized cultural production are not threats to art — they are its next evolution.<br><br>
            Art is not a relic. It is an engine. And the future belongs to those who build it.
